## F.A.Q.

**How to use plugin filters**

`wpmm_backtime` - can be used to change the backtime from page `Retry-After` header

```php
function new_backtime() {
    return 1800;
}

add_filter('wpmm_backtime', 'new_backtime');
```

Now... the search bots will retry to visit the page after 1800 seconds.

`wpmm_search_bots` - if you have `Bypass for Search Bots` option (from General) activated, it can be used to add / delete bots (useragents)

```php
function new_search_bots($bots) {
    // we delete a bot from array
    if(!empty($bots['AcoiRobot'])){ 
        unset($bots['AcoiRobot']);
    }

    // we add a new bot into array
    if(empty($bots['new_robot'])){ 
        $bots['new_robot'] = 'NewRobot'; // NewRobot is the user agent
    }

    return $bots;
}

add_filter('wpmm_search_bots', 'new_search_bots');
```

We deleted a bot from list and added a new one.

`wpmm_text` - can be used to change `Text` option

```php
function new_text($text) {
    $text = str_replace('https://www.designmodo.com', 'https://designmodo.com', $text);
    

    return $text;
}

add_filter('wpmm_text', 'new_text');
```

We replaced a string with another string. We can also add another text, add some extra html, etc.

`wpmm_styles` - can be used to embed new css files

```php
function new_css_styles($styles) {
    $styles['new-style'] = 'path_to_css_file/style.css'; // replace with the real path :)

    return $styles;
}

add_filter('wpmm_styles', 'new_css_styles');
```

We embedded a new css style on maintenance page. Same mechanism can be used for javascript files (see `wpmm_scripts` filter).

**Cache Plugin Support**

WP Maintenance Mode can be unstable due the cache plugins, we recommend to deactivate any cache plugin when maintenance mode is active.
