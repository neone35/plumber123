Shortcake makes using WordPress shortcodes a piece of cake.

== Description ==

Used alongside `add_shortcode`, Shortcake supplies a user-friendly interface for adding a shortcode to a post, and viewing and editing it from within the content editor.

Once you've installed the plugin, you'll need to [register UI for your shortcodes](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake/wiki/Registering-Shortcode-UI). For inspiration, check out [examples of Shortcake in the wild](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake/wiki/Shortcode-UI-Examples).

To report bugs or feature requests, [please use Github issues](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake/issues).

== Installation ==

Shortcake can be installed like any other WordPress plugin.

Once you've done so, you'll need to [register the UI for your code](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake/wiki/Registering-Shortcode-UI).

New in 0.4.0 is the ability to [attach javascript functions to event attribute updates](https://github.com/wp-shortcake/shortcake/wiki/Event-Attribute-Callbacks). Action hooks can be used to dynamically show or hide a field based on the value of another, or to implement custom validation rules.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I register UI for arbitrary key/value pairs as shortcode attributes? =

Shortcake doesn't support custom key => value pairs as shortcode attributes because it isn't a great user experience.

= After upgrading to Shortcake 0.7.x, some of the shortcode UI fields (post select, user select, etc) don't work as expected. What can I do? =

In version 0.7.0, we updated to the most recent branch of the Select2 library, which provides the enhanced select fields in these field types. This causes a known conflict with plugins that enqueue older versions of Select2. (Popular plugins with known conflicts include WooCommerce and Advanced Custom Fields Pro, among others.)

If you find that you're experiencing conflicts with these plugins, you can set a flag to load select2 in a distinct namespace by defining the constant `SELECT2_NOCONFLICT` in your wp-config.php (or anywhere that's defined before the 'init' hook.)

`
define( 'SELECT2_NOCONFLICT', true );
`

== Running tests ==

We have test coverage for PHP using PHPunit, and JavaScript using Jasmine.

= Running tests locally =

Jasmine tests can be run using `grunt jasmine` and are also run as part of the `grunt scripts` task. To update the core WordPress files used by the Jasmine test suite, run `grunt updateJasmineCoreScripts --abspath="/path/to/wordpress-install"`.

== Screenshots ==

1. Without Shortcake, shortcodes have a minimal UI.
2. But with Shortcake, TinyMCE will render the shortcode in a TinyMCE view.
3. And add a user-friendly UI to edit shortcode content and attributes.
4. Add new shortcodes to your post through "Add Media".

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.4.0 =

We've removed the compatibility shim for the `placeholder` attribute argument. You should register a placeholder for your field using the `meta` argument.

= 0.3.0 =

We've removed the compatibility shim for the magical `content` attribute. If you were using this to support editing inner content, you'll need to change your UI registration to use `inner_content`.

* When an attachment is already selected for a shortcode attribute, opening media library will include it selected.

* Added CSS utility classes to all field HTML. For instance, the attachment field is now wrapped with `shortcode-ui-field-attachment`.

* Attachment field: Refactored JavaScript to trigger events.
* Added a `range` input type.
* Introduced a `register_shortcode_ui` hook for plugins to more safely register UI with.

* [Full release notes](http://fusion.net/story/182883/introducing-shortcake-v0-5-0-sugar/)

= 0.4.0 (June 22, 2015) =

* [Full release notes](http://fusion.net/story/154890/introducing-shortcake-v0-4-0-strawberry/)

= 0.3.0 (April 27, 2015) =
* **Breaking change**: We've removed the compatibility shim for the magical `content` attribute. If you were using this to support editing inner content, you'll need to change your UI registration to use `inner_content`.
* New `post_select` field type for selecting from a list of posts. Supports an additional `query` parameter to modify the search query.
* Using a new `post_type` argument, shortcode UI can be registered for specific post types. This is helpful if you want the UI for a given shortcode to only appear on specific post types.
* For each shortcode attribute, a `meta` argument can be specified to add arbitrary HTML attributes to the field. We've added a compatibility shim for the existing `placeholder` argument. This compatibility shim will be removed in v0.4.
* When inserting a shortcode, UI shows a helpful message when the shortcode doesn't have attributes to configure. Previously, the user was presented with a relatively blank screen.
* Our example plugin can be activated through the WordPress admin.
* Clicking "Insert Post Element" in the left menu effectively acts as back button to selecting a shortcode.
* Language around the editing experience reflects the shortcode you're editing. For instance, with a pullquote shortcode,  "Edit Post Element" becomes "Edit Pullquote".
* Added Dutch translation.
* Source JavaScript files moved to `js/src` for clarity between source and built JavaScript.
* PHP files are scanned using PHP_CodeSniffer.
* Bug fix: Unquoted shortcode attributes are properly supported.
* Bug fix: Attachment field properly registers dependencies.
* Bug fix: "Insert Post Element" experience should work when visual editor is disabled. Shortcake is only loosely coupled with TinyMCE.
* Bug fix: Editor styles are loaded on `after_setup_theme` to prevent fatals.

* Fix WP 4.1 backwards compatibility issue by restoring arguments passed to TinyMCE view compatibility shim.

= 0.2.2 (April 6, 2015) =

* Ensure use of jQuery respects jQuery.noConflict() mode in WP.

= 0.2.0 (March 18, 2015) =
